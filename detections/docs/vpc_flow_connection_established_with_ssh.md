## Overview

Detect when a VPC network flow established an SSH connection. SSH connections, while commonly used for legitimate administrative purposes, can also be leveraged for unauthorized access to resources, lateral movement within networks, or command and control activities by attackers. Monitoring SSH connections helps identify potentially suspicious remote access patterns, especially from unexpected sources, to sensitive resources or across security boundaries within your AWS environment.
