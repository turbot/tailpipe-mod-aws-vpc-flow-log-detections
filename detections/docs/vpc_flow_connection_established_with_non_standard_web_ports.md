## Overview

Detect when a VPC network flow established a connection to web services on non-standard ports (excluding common ports 80, 443, 8080, 8443). Web services running on unusual ports may indicate potential security control evasion techniques, command and control channels, or misconfigured services. Monitoring connections to non-standard web ports helps identify adversaries attempting to bypass port-based filtering, maintain persistence through covert channels, or exploit misconfigured services that may have weaker security controls.
