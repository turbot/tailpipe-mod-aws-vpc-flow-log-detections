## Overview

Detect when a connection was rejected in VPC Flow Logs. Rejected connections can indicate security group misconfigurations, network access control list (NACL) issues, or potential unauthorized access attempts. Monitoring rejected connections helps identify potential intrusion attempts, network segmentation issues, and configuration problems that could impact application availability or security posture.
