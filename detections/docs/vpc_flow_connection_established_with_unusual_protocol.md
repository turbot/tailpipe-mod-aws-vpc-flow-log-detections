## Overview

Detect when a VPC network flow established a connection using unusual protocols (non-TCP, UDP, or ICMP). Unusual protocol usage may indicate potential tunneling techniques, covert communication channels, or command and control traffic attempting to evade security controls. Monitoring for uncommon protocols helps identify adversaries using non-standard communication methods to maintain persistence, exfiltrate data, or control compromised systems while bypassing traditional detection mechanisms focused on common protocols.
