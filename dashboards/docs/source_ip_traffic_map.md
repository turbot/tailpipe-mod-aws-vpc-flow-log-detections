This dashboard answers the following questions:

- What destinations are receiving traffic from the selected source IP?
- How much traffic (in bytes and flow count) is transmitted to each destination?
- Which AWS resources (ENIs, EC2 instances, subnets, VPCs) are involved in handling this traffic?
- Which ECS components (tasks, services, clusters) are related to this traffic?
- What protocols and ports are used in the communication?
- How are the traffic paths structured â€” from source IP to destination, and through which resources?
