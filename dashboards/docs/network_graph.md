This dashboard answers the following questions:

- Which IP addresses are involved in VPC traffic, either as source or destination?
- What traffic relationships exist between these IP addresses?
- Which IP address pairs have high connection volumes (e.g., over 50 connections)?
- Are there any unusual or heavily trafficked paths between nodes in the network?
