## Overview

Adversaries may leverage the resources of co-opted systems to complete resource-intensive tasks, which may impact system and/or hosted service availability.

Resource hijacking may take a number of different forms. For example, adversaries may:

- Leverage compute resources in order to mine cryptocurrency
- Sell network bandwidth to proxy networks
- Generate SMS traffic for profit
- Abuse cloud-based messaging services to send large quantities of spam messages

In some cases, adversaries may leverage multiple types of Resource Hijacking at once.
